GV is based on object-oriented programming (OOP):  all the main concepts
(environments, states, observations, actions, grids, grid-objects, the agent,
etc.) are represented by corresponding classes with associated data and
behaviors.  Learning and understanding these classes and their interfaces is
crucial for the ability to create custom environments.
