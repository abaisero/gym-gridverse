  :py:class:`~gym_gridverse.grid_object.NoneGridObject`
    A :py:class:`~gym_gridverse.grid_object.NoneGridObject` is the object held
    by the agent by default if it is not holding any other
    gym_gridverse.grid_object.GridObject.

  :py:class:`~gym_gridverse.grid_object.Hidden`
    A :py:class:`~gym_gridverse.grid_object.Hidden` is the grid-object used to
    indicate a non-observable
