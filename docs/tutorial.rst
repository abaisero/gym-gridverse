Gridverse (GV) is a library for the construction of custom gridworld
MDP and POMDP environments.  Its main purpose is to allow you, the designer, to
easily create environments based on your research needs.  These sections serve
as a tutorial which will guide you towards understanding the inner workings of
the library, the usage of predefined components, and the creation of your own
custom components.

But before that, let's first have a quick look at what we're talking about.  GV
provides a few useful scripts, one of which is
:download:`scripts/gv_control_loop_gym.py
</../scripts/gv_control_loop_gym.py>`, which visualizes the behavior of a
random policy.  Open a terminal, move to the root of the project, load a python
environment with GV installed, and run::

  gv_control_loop_gym.py yaml/gv_memory_nine_rooms.13x13.yaml

This should open two windows, and start printing some data.

.. figure:: /figures/introduction.png
  :name: introduction
  :width: 75%
  :align: center

  Global state (left) and agent observation (right).

The windows respectively represent the state of the environment (the bigger
one) and the observation received by the agent (the smaller one).  You'll note
the agent (black triangle) moving around in a gridworld which contains the
following grid-objects:

* Floor cells (gray tiles);
* Wall cells (red bricks);
* Exit cells (colored flags);
* Beacon cells (colored circle with cross).

Because the agent is just selecting random actions, its behavior will be a
quite boring random walk.  In the terminal, you should see some information
corresponding to its behavior and trajectory.

.. figure:: /figures/introduction-terminal.png
  :name: introduction-terminal
  :align: center

  Raw data associated with :numref:`introduction`.

These include:

* Episode index;
* Timestep index;
* Action (as integer);
* Reward;
* Observation (as dictionary of numpy arrays);
* Done condition.

.. caution::
  The graphics in :numref:`introduction` are specifically **for human
  comsumption only**, and do not represent how this data is provided to the
  agent.  Rather, the ``Observation`` field in :numref:`introduction-terminal`
  shows how this data is provided to the agent, i.e., in the form of a
  dictionary of numpy arrays.  The state (omitted) has a similar structure,
  albeit with a different set of keys.  Both data formats will be explained
  later in this tutorial.
